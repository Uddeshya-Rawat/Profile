                Hi, I'm <strong>Uddeshya Rawat</strong>, a passionate <strong>MERN Stack Developer</strong> with a strong academic foundation and real-world experience in building dynamic and scalable web applications.
                <br /><br />
                I hold a <strong>Diploma in Electronics and Electrical Engineering</strong> from Government Polytechnic, Narendra Nagar, and a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong> from G. B. Pant Institute of Engineering and Technology.
                <br /><br />
                My journey into software development led me to specialize in the <strong>MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)</strong>. I enjoy crafting clean, responsive, and high-performing user interfaces while ensuring seamless backend functionality.
                <br /><br />
                Some of the projects I’ve developed include a <strong>Task Management App</strong>, a <strong>Food Ordering App</strong>, a <strong>MERN Stack To-Do App</strong>, and a <strong>Gallery App</strong>. These projects have helped me sharpen my skills in component-based architecture, API integration, and full-stack development.
                <br /><br />
                I’m a firm believer in continuous learning and often explore new technologies, libraries, and best practices. I’m always ready to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful digital solutions that solve real-world problems.
